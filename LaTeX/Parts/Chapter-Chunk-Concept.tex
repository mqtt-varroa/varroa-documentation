\chapter{Chunk Concept}
\section{Definition}
A chunk is a type of container designed to distribute data from the Commander to its Agents.
It contains:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the amount of clients a chunk represents.
	\item the commands that are applied to the clients in the chunk.
	\item information concerning the MQTT-specific properties.
	\item variables defining lifecycle properties.
\end{itemize}

\section{Purpose of Chunks}
Due to the distributed nature of Varroa it was necessary to be able to spread the information contained in the scenario.
To secure a deterministic distribution of a scenario's data the chunks had to be evenly spread across the initialized Agents.
To ensure this determinism a mechanism was introduced combining a round-robin selection of chunks with a handshake mechanism of the agents.
