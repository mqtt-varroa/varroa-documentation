The Name of our MQTT-Scenario-Testing-Tool is inspired by Varroa mites.
Varroa is a species of mites that infest honeybee colonies. %TODO cite
Our MQTT-Scenario-Testing-Tool with the same name works in similar ways: it targets MQTT-brokers and tests their resilience to load.
In that context load can be defined as the utilization of a MQTT-broker due to a big amount of MQTT-clients connected, that publish and subscribe to a lot of topics and show complex sequences of their interactions with the broker.\\
\\
Varroa simulates the behaviour of large amounts of MQTT-clients -- called scenarios -- to determine the limit of the loading capacity of the targeted MQTT-Broker.
As a speciality Varroa is organized as a distributed system, due to the almost impossible simulation of enough MQTT-clients on a single machine to overload a MQTT-Broker, especially if the broker is also a distributed system.
